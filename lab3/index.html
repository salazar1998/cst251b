	<h1>Lab 3: File Stuctures</h1>
		<p>The big idea for this lab was to work with a partner to
			create a local file structure on our computer and add index.html files.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>A challenge that we ran into was how to organize  our files
			well. After that, the assignment went pretty smooth. We problem
			 solved and were able to work though most of our problems. We only had one problem,
			 when we ran index.html square symbols showed up above our links.
			 We cross referenced our codes but found no significant diffences.	</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results for this lab gave us more insight on how we can use stuctures
			to further develop our websites. We were able to add images, create lists,
			and add links. However, we were not able to solve our only problem. Below
			are screenshots of our file structures:</p>
